# Glider-landing-using-2-servo-motors-and-GPS
This code is very simple and is only recommended if you are using exactly two servo motors and one sensor, a GPS module. If you have more sensors and servo motors available, this code won't provide the best performance.It is recommended to put both the servo motors on the tail(rudder and elevator) but if you want, you can move one of the servo motors to the aileron or even add one to have three servo motors on all the three control surfaces but make the necessary changes to the code.
Refer the flow chart to understand the concept behind the code.
